                Above all else everything I do is in the effort of process
                improvement. IT is here to enhance operations and as such
                changes should always be done with operational needs in mind.
                When I first step foot into a new environment I do three things:
                (1) Identify areas of technical debt (2) Note who key IT
                stakeholders are (3) Devise an IT Roadmap. By technical debt I
                refer to hardware, software, or technical workflows that are
                insufficient, end of life, and/or needs further enhancement.
              </span>
              <span className="card-Text">
                Finding an organization&apos;s key IT stakeholders is vital
                because it formalizes change management, enables the formation
                of an IT Steering Committee, and opens communication pathways
                with locations, departments, and/or other organizational units.
                Both of these action items enable me to develop an IT Roadmap to
                collaboratively drive with C-level management. As a part of the
                roadmap I break down projects to address technical debt as well
                as ones that can enhance current/needed operational processes.

                Getting a report card of your security posture can be a
                time-consuming task depending on your organization&apos;s size,
                type, and manner of work. I tend to break down posture analysis
                in priority order across four categories: (1) Legal Requirements
                (2) Regulatory Compliance (3) Environment Complexity (4) Future
                Plans. When it comes to legal requirements I refer to security
                needs on the basis of criminal and civil liability and in the US
                is outlined federally and potentially within your state. Consult
                your legal experts on what your expectations are in the face of
                laws on the books and a hint - ask how and why organizations
                similar to yours have faced legal issues historically.
              </span>
              <span className="card-Text">
                Regulatory compliance is typically related to your industry or
                how you manage sensitive customer data. If you are in the
                medical field your organization should have a designated HIPAA
                Officer who can help answer questions even in the realm of IT.
                For those under PCI DSS, there&apos;s a growing surge in vendors
                providing compliancy services including penetration testing and
                I&apos;d recommend touching base with them as a first step.
                After seeing if your environment meets legal and compliance
                criteria, ask your IT if there&apos;s any lingering security
                gaps such as CVEs or weak authentication/authorization systems
                in place. Finally, I recommend developing an IT Roadmap of your
                own because by doing so in advance you can also strategize
                around the security ramifications of future plans.

                In my experience, tickets tell the story. Even if you don&apos;t
                have a dedicated IT Team or a MSP on an agreement I recommend
                tracking IT issues/requests even if rudimentarily via Excel,
                Google Sheets, OneNote, etc. Hardware is typically easier to
                evaluate because after ruling out the network and software at
                play, even non-IT people can deduce computers are old and need
                to be replaced or are new but bought with insufficient specs.
                Network components are quite static and only really need to be
                replaced if there&apos;s equipment-related performance issues
                and/or severe security vulnerabilities at play.

                Software and systems in general are where evaluation becomes
                quite dynamic. In the realm of software it always seems like
                everyone can tell you what to buy but with so many options how
                do you know if you actually have a case to switch or are being
                sold to? This is when I tell organizations to dare to demo -
                software companies are much more willing to provide trials with
                typically adequate feature sets nowadays. For email and
                productivity apps as an example Microsoft 365 and GSuite offer
                30-day, fully-featured, no-questions-asked trials across the
                vast majority of their offerings. If issues persist after
                investigating these domains, it&apos;s typically indicative of
                operational workflow issues where it&apos;s not an issue of what
                you have but how you&apos;re using it.
